                Staying Focused is too much important to achieve something. It can be being web developer, being an honest man, being a caring boyfriend also and so on. People around us will try to make us as like as themselve. But we should not be like them rather we should be focused as much as possible.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Let me talk about my mission to be a web developer first. Being a web developer should be taken as a mission. Without having this as a mission we can not achieve it because being a web developer is not so easy. The importance of taking something as a mission actually can't be described in a word.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Our personal vision should be how our commit to living our life. It influences all areas including family, spirituality, physical well-being, leisure and work.  A vision should contain our interests and passions what we enjoy doing in our free time.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    The main vital goal of a person is to be healthy physically and psychologically. There are not so many people who are self-confident, with positive self-esteem, who know their worth and are able to fulfill their desires. We are able to set a goal of life, to take up the solution of a vital problem for all mankind.

                    We tired of second-guessing if our professional development efforts are meeting the mark. We're ready to build the professional learning. We should be very active and be effective. Because we have to be web developer. For that we need to practice more and more. We need to practice coding. Without a clear system of high-quality training and support, our youth-focused initiative may not sustain. And it's almost clear that without hard work being web developer is quite impossible. <br><br>
